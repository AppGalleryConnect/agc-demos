## auth quickstart

## Introduction
You can use App Messaging of AppGallery Connect to send relevant messages to target users actively using your app to encourage them to use key app functions. For example, you can send in-app messages to encourage users to subscribe to certain products, provide tips on passing a game level, or recommend activities of a restaurant.

App Messaging even allows you to customize how your messages look and the way they will be sent, and define events for triggering message sending to your users at the right moment.

## Preparing the Environment
