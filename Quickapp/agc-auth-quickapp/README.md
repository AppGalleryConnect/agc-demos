## Introduction
Most apps need to identify and authenticate users to tailor the app experience for individual users. However, building such a system from scratch is a difficult process. Auth Service can quickly build a secure and reliable user authentication system for your app. You only need to access Auth Service capabilities in your app without caring about the facilities and implementation on the cloud.

## Preparing the Environments
* A computer with Huawei QuickApp IDE
* A device can run QuickApp

2. Use your account to sign in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-get-started), create a project and add an app, set app platform to Quick App.
