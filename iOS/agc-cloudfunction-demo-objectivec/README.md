## function quickstart

## Introduction
Cloud Functions enables serverless computing. It provides the Function as a Service (FaaS) capabilities to simplify app development and O&M so your ideas can be realized more easily and your service capabilities can be built more quickly.
1. Cloud Functions provides an efficient and reliable framework for developing and running functions. It frees you from complex traditional development and O&M of apps. Server configuration and management, code deployment, load balancing, autoscaling, and high reliability assurance are now streamlined.
You only need to focus on service logic and function code to build reliable and scalable serverless apps. 
2. As the core of serverless computing, Cloud Functions works with other cloud services like building blocks to implement your service logic.
