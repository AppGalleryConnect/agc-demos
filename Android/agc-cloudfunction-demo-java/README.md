## Introduction
Cloud Functions enables serverless computing. It provides the Function as a Service (FaaS) capabilities to simplify app development and O&M so your ideas can be realized more easily and your service capabilities can be built more quickly.
1. Cloud Functions provides an efficient and reliable framework for developing and running functions. It frees you from complex traditional development and O&M of apps. Server configuration and management, code deployment, load balancing, autoscaling, and high reliability assurance are now streamlined.
You only need to focus on service logic and function code to build reliable and scalable serverless apps.
2. As the core of serverless computing, Cloud Functions works with other cloud services like building blocks to implement your service logic.

## Preparing the Environment
* A computer with Android Studio installed for app development
* A device or emulator in Android Studio running Android 4.2 or a later version


## Getting Started
Before running the quickstart app, you need to:
1. If you do not have a HUAWEI Developer account, you need to register an account and pass identity verification.

3.3 Click New Function on the Functions page.
3.4 Define the function on the page that is displayed.
3.5 Click Save.
4. Download the agconnect-services.json file from AppGallery Connect and replace place it in the application-level root directory (for example: quickstart is function/app/.)
Before compiling the APK, please make sure that the project includes the agconnect-services.json file, otherwise a compilation error will occur.
