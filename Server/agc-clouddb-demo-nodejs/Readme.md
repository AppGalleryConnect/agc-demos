## Introduction
- This is a quickstart sample demonstrating the Cloud DB Api for Node.js. It is implemented based on the Node.js SDK.
- The Cloud DB Server SDK is designed to manage your data in your Cloud DB project and work best in the Cloud Functions environment. You can access the Cloud DB backend to perform data operations via this SDK directly.

## Getting Started
- Before starting this demo, you need to refer to Cloud DB doument(https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-clouddb-introduction) to create the CloudDBZone and object type.
- Refer to Cloud Function document(https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-cloudfunction-programmode), you can upload zip packet or online editing to test the demo.
1) When you use zip packet, you can compress the CloudDBApi.js, cert.pem and handler.js in the src folder to a zip package and upload it to the project.
2) When you use online editing, you can put CloudDBApi.js, cert.pem and handler.js code into your project. You can modify handler.js code to meet your need.
- Note that when you use Cloud Function service to enjoy Cloud DB service, you have to add CloudDBApi.js and cert.pem into your project. In order not to affect your enjoyment of the service, modifying CloudDBApi.js and cert.pem code is not allowed.

- After preparing the project, referring to Cloud Function document(https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-cloudfunction-test), you can test the demo.
