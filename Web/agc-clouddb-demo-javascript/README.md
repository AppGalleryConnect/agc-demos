- Click **Cloud DB** on the navigation bar and enable database service. Then, perform the following operations:

    （1）Create a schema by importing a template file stored in **CloudDBQuickStart_1.json** in the root directory of the project. Alternatively, create a schema named **BookInfo** and ensure that all fields must be the same as those in **BookInfo.js** in the project.

    （2） Create a Cloud DB zone. On the **Cloud DB Zone** tab page, click **Add** to create a Cloud DB zone named **QuickStartDemo**.
