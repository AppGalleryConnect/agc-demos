## Remote Config QuickStart

## Introduction
Remote Configuration allows you to manage parameters online. With the service, you can change the behavior and appearance of your app online without requiring users to update the app. Remote Configuration provides cloud-based services, the console, and the client SDK. By integrating the client SDK, your app can periodically obtain parameter values delivered on the console to modify the app's behavior and appearance.
