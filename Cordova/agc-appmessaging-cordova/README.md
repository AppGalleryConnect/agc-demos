## 3. Configuration and Description

### Accessing Analytics Kit

Currently, HMS Analytics Cordova Plugin is not supported with AGC AppMessaging Plugin. 

To use analytics feature, 

- Navigate into your <root_directory>/platforms/android/app/build.gradle and add build dependencies in the dependencies section.
   
    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.huawei.hms:hianalytics:5.1.0.301'
    }
    ```
- Navigate into your <root_directory>/platforms/ios file and edit the Podfile file to add the pod dependency 'HiAnalytics'
    
    - Example Podfile file:

        ```
        # Pods for AGCAppMessagingDemo
        pod 'HiAnalytics'
        ```
    
    - Run pod install to install the pods.
    
       ```
       $ pod install
       ```
    
    - Initialize the Analytics SDK using the config API in AppDelegate in iOS platform.

        Sample code for initialization in AppDelegate.m:
    
        ```
        #import "AppDelegate.h"
        #import <HiAnalytics/HiAnalytics.h>
 
        @implementation AppDelegate
        ...
        // Customize the service logic after app launch.
        - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions {
          self.viewController = [[MainViewController alloc] init];
        // Initialize the Analytics SDK.
        [HiAnalytics config];   
         return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
        }
        ...
        @end
        ```
