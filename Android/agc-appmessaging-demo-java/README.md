## appmessaging quickstart

## Introduction
You can use App Messaging to send relevant messages to users actively using your app to encourage them to use key app functions.

## Preparing the Environment
Before using the quickstart app, prepare your Android development environment.


## Environment Requirements
Android Studio 3.0 or later.
	
## Configuration
Before running the quickstart app, you need to:
1. Register an account and pass identity verification if you do not have a HUAWEI Developer account.
2. Use your account to sign in to AppGallery Connect, create an app, and set Package type to APK (Android app).
3. Enable App Messaging and creat a message.
4. Download the agconnect-services.json file from AppGallery Connect and save it to the app root directory (appmessaging/app/ for the quickstart app).
Before compiling the APK, ensure that you have saved the agconnect-services.json file to your project. Otherwise, a compilation error will occur.
