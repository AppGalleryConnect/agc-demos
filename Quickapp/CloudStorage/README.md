## Procedure
1. Activate cloud storage service: The cloud storage service is not activated by default. You need to manually activate the cloud storage service in AGC.

2. New storage instance: After opening the cloud storage service, AGC will automatically create a default storage instance. If you want to store application system data and user data separately, you can create a new storage instance yourself.

3.Copy all properties in the agconnectconfig object in Project Settings > SDK code snippets to“ agConnectConfig.js ”under the agconnectconfig object of the profile, and under the "cloud storage" tab, add "default_storage"to set the default storage instance.

4. Integrated SDK: If you need to use cloud storage-related functions in the application client, you must integrate the cloud storage client SDK.

5. Initialize the cloud storage: Before the application client uses the cloud storage, you need to initialize the cloud storage and specify the storage instance used by the client.

6. File management: The application client can call the API of the cloud storage SDK to perform operations such as uploading files, downloading files, deleting files, and modifying file metadata.

## Supported Environments
Google Chrome 73 or later version is recommended.
