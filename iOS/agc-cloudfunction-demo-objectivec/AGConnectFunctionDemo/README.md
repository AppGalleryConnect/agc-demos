## function quickstart

## Introduction
Cloud Functions enables serverless computing. It provides the Function as a Service (FaaS) capabilities to simplify app development and O&M so your ideas can be realized more easily and your service capabilities can be built more quickly.
1. Cloud Functions provides an efficient and reliable framework for developing and running functions. It frees you from complex traditional development and O&M of apps. Server configuration and management, code deployment, load balancing, autoscaling, and high reliability assurance are now streamlined.
You only need to focus on service logic and function code to build reliable and scalable serverless apps. 
2. As the core of serverless computing, Cloud Functions works with other cloud services like building blocks to implement your service logic. 

## Preparing the Environment
Before using the quickstart app, prepare your iOS development environment.


## Environment Requirements
Xcode 8.0 or later.
	
## Configuration
Before running the quickstart app, you need to:
1. If you do not have a HUAWEI Developer account, you need to register an account and pass identity verification.
2. Use your account to sign in to AppGallery Connect, create an app, and set Package type to iOS.
3. Create a cloud function. (For details, please refer to the development guide.)
3.1 Sign in to AppGallery Connect, select My apps, and click the product of the app for which you want to enable Auth Service.
3.2 Go to Develop > Build > Cloud functions. The Cloud Functions page is displayed.
3.3 Click New Function on the Functions page. 
3.4 Define the function on the page that is displayed.
